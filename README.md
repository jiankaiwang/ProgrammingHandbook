# Software World

This book is designed to summarize different kinds of programming languages, including syntax, resource, etc. Further, it is also designed to collect lots of programming implementation by different conditions in need. Is it a book? Moreover, I regard it as a note, manual or handbook instead.

In the book, we introduce several programming languages. It includes C++, Java, C#/ASP.NET, Android, GO, Python

So, let us explore wonderful software world.
