This book is designed to summarize different kinds of programming languages, including syntax, resource, etc. Further, it is also designed to collect lots of programming implementation by different conditions in need. Is it a book? Moreover, I regard it as a note, manual or handbook instead.

So, let us explore wonderful software world.
